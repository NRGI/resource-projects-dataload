# Hello there!

**What is this?** This is the **community tracker** for work to **load data** into [ResourceProjects][http://resourceprojects.org/]
(including tracking down, scraping, cleaning that data!). You can use it to:

- Register a data set for someone (maybe you!) to work on in the future
- Find new load you could contribute to
- Update on progress you are making working on data
- Discuss any of the above!

*A note on the technology: in theory this is some kind of git repo (don’t worry if you don’t know what that is). However, we’re just using the [issue tracker][issues] part of it -- there’s no code or any complex stuff.*

[ResourceProjects]: http://resourceprojects.org/
[issues]: https://github.com/NRGI/resource-projects-dataload/issues
[new]: https://github.com/NRGI/resource-projects-dataload/issues/new
